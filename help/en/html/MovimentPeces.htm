  <li>To move a piece from place to place of the game zone, he owes&nbsp;cliking
and drag with the mouse the piece wished. Getting the pieces of the
game zone out is not possible. When releasing the button, if the piece
remains with some of his vertices close to the vertex of other piece,
that will notice the piece of "drawback." This effect, that her correct
solution facilitates figures, he can avoid pressing the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ctrl</span> key before releasing the button from the mouse.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rotate a piece.</span> In the <span style="font-weight: bold;">childlike</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">novice</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">initiated</span> levels, enough&nbsp;cliking the mouse right button on a piece&nbsp;so this turns.&nbsp;In the <span style="font-weight: bold;">expert</span> level case, to turn a piece he owes&nbsp;cliking 
and drag the mouse in the wished turn sense. If the piece is very close
to the game zone limits that I do not turn is possible because of which
