</big></big></big></p>
The program can generate new figures. This option is only available for
some of the modalities of game . You can do that the program
generate a figure with the option of menu&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Generates figures -&gt; Generates figure</span> (or with the combination of keys&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ctrl+R</span>). The program will generate a new figure and will be able to try resolve it inmediatament.<br>

<br>
With the option <span style="font-weight: bold;">Generates figures -&gt; Generates figures</span> (or with the combination of keys <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ctrl+Q</span>) will be able to generate figures massively (until 300). Only you have to enter the number of figures that wish to generate.<br>

<br>
The process of generation is quite random: still like this, it is
possible that generate&nbsp; some figure repeated. Therefore, with the
option of menu <span style="font-weight: bold;">Generates figures -&gt; Checks figures</span>
will be able to review the figures generated. With this screen can do
that the program check if there are figures repeated between the
figures generated or if any of the figures generated already is in the
collection of the figures of the program. After doing the checking, the
program marks automatically the figures repeated to delete them. You
can mark other figures (for example any in that the pieces are not
placed forming an only figure) with the button of elimination (<img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../../imatges/cross.png">).<br>

<br>
To all the figures generated assigns them&nbsp; the name «AUTO»,
followed of a number generated at random. You can do that the program
renumere correlatively the figures of automatic form with the button<img style="width: 32px; height: 32px;" alt="" src="../../imatges/noms.png">.<br>

<br>
Once done the changes, can save the data in an archive. To play with the figures generated, only have to use the option of menu <span style="font-weight: bold;">Application-&gt;Loads figures of an archive</span> and select the archive wished.<br>
