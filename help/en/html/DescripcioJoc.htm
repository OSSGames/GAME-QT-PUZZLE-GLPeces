<p></p>




<p>To play, he selects the kind of game (menu <span style="font-weight: bold;">Game</span>-&gt;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Kind of game</span>) and the level (menu&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Play</span>-&gt;<span style="font-weight: bold;">game Level</span>)
Select a figure calling on his name the tree of figures. When doing it,
he will be able to display the figure in the game zone (if they have
selected the childlike, novice or initiated level)</p>The game starts
when moving some of the pieces. He begins to run the time then. He must
place the pieces without they superposing one.<p>In the Childlike level, the pieces place one in his position automatically when they are established in the figure outline.</p>

<p>He can stop the game cliking on the name of other figure or good on
the first itme of the figure tree (with that name of the form and of
the level current).</p><p>Making the program to suggest a figure at random is possible (menu <span style="font-weight: bold;">Game</span>-&gt;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Suggest figure</span> or good with the combination of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ctrl+P</span> keys.) Also looking for a figure by his name is possible (menu <span style="font-weight: bold;">Game</span>-&gt;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Search figure name</span> or good with the combination of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ctrl+N</span> keys.)<br>

</p>




<p>He can require help of the program with the menu options&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Game</span>-&gt;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Places piece</span> (the program will place the piece cliked) and with the option <span style="font-weight: bold;">Game</span> -&gt;<span style="font-weight: bold;">View solution</span> (view the solution in the game zone.) The two options deduct points.</p>





<p>If he manages to solve the figure, the program will indicate it
showing the outline in green, one he will update the counter and he
will stop the clock. The
program keeps your solution: just click on the figure name to view your
solution. You can remove the solution with a double click. The punctuation of each figure depends on the form
of the game and of the figure difficulty. Three levels distinguish one
from difficulty indicated by the point of green (easier), yellow
(medium) and red (difficult) color.<br>
