<p>The program allows the creation of new figures. To create a new
figure, not being in phase of solving of a figure is necessary. If he
has already started the solving of a figure, he can stop the game
clicking on the first item figure tree.</p><p>With the stopped game, he can build the new figure. Next, with the menu option <span style="font-weight: bold;">Game</span>-&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Create new Shape</span>-&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Checks sample</span> (or well with the combination of keys <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ctrl+M</span>)
can check that figure sample and the outline are seen correctly. I
could that some tightening is necessary. Give birth he erases the
sample and the outline uses the new option of menu <span style="font-weight: bold;">Game</span>-&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Create new Shape</span>-&gt;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Erase sample</span> (or the combination of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Crtl+E</span> keys).<br></p>

<p>When he has the new figure, checking can if some figure similar already exists with the menu option&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Game</span>-&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Create new Shape</span>-&gt;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Search figure</span> (or with the combination of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ctrl+F</span>&nbsp;
keys.) The program will look for coincidences between the figures of
the figure tree and the shaped by the pieces in the game zone. At the
end, the program will report on the found coincidences.<br>

</p>

<p>Finally, you can saving the data of the new&nbsp;figure (or good with the combination of D Crtl keys)&nbsp;using the menu&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Game</span>-&gt; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Create new Shape</span>-&gt;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Save the shape</span> (or&nbsp;with the combination of<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;Crtl+D</span> keys). He will must assign a descriptive figure name&nbsp;and a difficulty level. You can select the saving file folder with the button&nbsp;<img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="../../imatges/directori.png">.</p>He is able creating as many figures want. At any moment, using the&nbsp;menu option <span style="font-weight: bold;">Program</span>-&gt;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Load figures from a file</span> he can have the created figures in the tree of figures to play.<br><br>The
figure data is saving in a text file. You can send&nbsp;the figure text
files to the program author and they will be added to the program.<br>
