<big><big><big>He helps the figure solving</big></big></big>
<p>The program offers two kinds of help in the solving of her figures: Showing the solution (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Game-&gt; View the solution</span>) or placing the pieces individually.</p>

<p>The last option is accessible in the menu option <span style="font-weight: bold;">Game-&gt;Places piece</span>.
Once activated the menu option, to the click on a piece, this will
place one in his position. Click on each one of the pieces, will manage
to obtain the solution.<br>
</p>





<p>If he uses this help option, the program will deduct the proportional part of the punctuation by each one of the placed pieces.</p></body></html>
